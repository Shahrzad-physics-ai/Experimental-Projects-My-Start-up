I am an experimental physicist passionate about hands-on research and solving real-world problems through interdisciplinary approaches.

Master's Thesis: WO3 Thin Films

During my Master's, I investigated the deposition of tungsten trioxide (WO3) thin films using RF sputtering, studying their optical and structural properties at the nanoscale. This work explored potential applications in smart windows, gas sensors, and solar cells, and resulted in a conference publication on the role of nanomaterials in improving smart window performance.

Nanotechnology Competition & Start-up

Following my thesis, I participated in the National Nanotechnology Competition, which connects innovative ideas to technology commercialization. I developed a nano-adsorbent from agricultural waste (leaves and stems of dry tea), advancing it to a working prototype showcased at the 13th National Nanotechnology Exhibition. Through this process, I confronted real challenges of production feasibility, market requirements, and prototype development, experiences that gave me a practical understanding of taking an idea from concept to functional product.

Across both projects, I gained extensive hands-on experience with a variety of experimental techniques, including SEM, AFM, TEM, XRD, UV-Vis spectroscopy, BET, and more, which have become integral to my approach in combining experimental rigor with practical problem-solving.
